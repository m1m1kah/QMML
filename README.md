# Welcome to the Queen Mary Machine Leaning (QMML) Society

Our QMML Society hosts multiple weekly events!

Our two main branches are the **AI/ML Lectures** and **Kaggle Seasons**.

## ***AI/ML Lectures***

Manu holds weekly lectures on a variety of key Machine Learning topics. The lectures start by covering fundamental materials and we move onto more advanced algorithms present in cutting edge reserach and used in industry.
Paritcipants can obtain a certificate of completion by engaging with the Lecture questions, showing a robust understanding of the topics covered.
