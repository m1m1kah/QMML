# Google Gemma 2 AI Hackathon

We sent one of our teams from the QMML society to the Google Gemma 2 AI Hackathon where over 1350 participants applied but only 60 were invited to the Google office in London for in-person talks and workshops. Our Team of 6 people were all within those 60 that got invited.

Over the course of 4 days our team developed InSightMail, which is thoughtfully crafted to enhance accessibility, enabling individuals who are blind to seamlessly manage and communicate through their Gmail inbox. Leveraging the advanced Gemma 2 model, InSightMail transforms email interaction into an intuitive and natural language experience.

## **Key Features:**
- Email Summarization: Quickly grasp the essence of your messages with concise and clear summaries.
- Smart Email Responses: Effortlessly reply to emails using intelligent, context-aware suggestions.
- AI-Powered Email Drafting: Compose well-articulated emails with the assistance of our sophisticated AI drafting tool.
- Experience a more accessible and efficient way to stay connected with InSightMail—where technology meets inclusivity.

Our teams' AI system is available as an [open-source repository](https://github.com/KarlLearnsAI/InSightMail)
