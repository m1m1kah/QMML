## Full Description
We sent one of our teams from the QMML Society to the Google Gemma 2 AI Hackathon where over 1350 participants applied but only 60 were invited to the Google office in London for in-person talks and workshops. Our team of 6 were all among the 60 invited.

Over the course of 4 days our team developed InSightMail, which is thoughtfully crafted to enhance accessibility, enabling individuals who are blind to seamlessly manage and communicate through their Gmail inbox. Leveraging the advanced Gemma 2 model, InSightMail transforms email interaction into an intuitive and natural language experience.

### **Key Features:**
- Email Summarization: Quickly grasp the essence of your messages with concise and clear summaries.
- Smart Email Responses: Effortlessly reply to emails using intelligent, context-aware suggestions.
- AI-Powered Email Drafting: Compose well-articulated emails with the assistance of our sophisticated AI drafting tool.
- Experience a more accessible and efficient way to stay connected with InSightMail—where technology meets inclusivity.
